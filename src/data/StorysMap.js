  bio: `I'm Nika, a 34-year-old developer from Tbilisi, Georgia, a small and beautiful country.

Since childhood, I’ve loved solving puzzles, playing logic games, and setting goals that truly challenge me. I’ve always found joy in pushing myself — and I still do.

I graduated high school in 2009 and went on to study at the Georgian Technical University. Years later, in 2017 I founded A-Store, an e-commerce startup. Although I started coding later than most, I quickly realized it was the perfect fit for my skills and mindset — and I genuinely love what I do.
One of my strongest qualities is the ability to learn quickly and independently, and get real results...

  works: `My professional journey is marked by a blend of entrepreneurial spirit and a deep dive into technology. In 2018, while launching my e-commerce startup, A-Store, I gained valuable experience in digital marketing, photography, and graphic design. However, it was my immersion in programming that truly resonated, quickly becoming my most fulfilling professional endeavor.

  Within approximately six months of starting to code, I began developing an application designed to solve a real problem for courier companies, offering a complete service solution. This application quickly sold during its development phase and, upon completion, transformed into a successful product now used by many.  
  
  I approach every project with meticulous time management and a high level of responsibility, paying close attention to every detail. Most importantly, I genuinely love what I do. Writing clean, scalable code and bringing ideas to life isn’t just my profession — it’s something that gives me energy, focus, and purpose every day.

  hobby: `Outside of work, I enjoy several hobbies that keep me active and creative. I love watching and playing football, and I'm also good at tennis and billiards. Photography is another passion of mine – I enjoy taking pictures. I also love to travel and explore new places, always looking for interesting adventures.`,
