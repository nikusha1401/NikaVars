  bio: `I'm Nika, 25 years old, based in Tbilisi.
    I began programming around three years ago,
    but my curiosity for technology started much earlier —
    I was always drawn to logic puzzles, strategic games,
    and any activity that challenged my thinking and focus.

    What started as a hobby quickly became something more.
    I realized this is the kind of work where I feel most natural and productive.
    I genuinely enjoy building functional systems, paying attention to details,
    and understanding how digital products are created from the ground up.

    Today, I’m growing steadily in both frontend and backend development,
    and I’m purposefully working toward building real professional experience.`,
